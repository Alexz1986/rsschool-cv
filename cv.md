### I am 35. My aim is to learn something new and may be change professional activity in future.I have a conscious desire to learn, I have motivation.
### In the university I have learned such programming languages as C, C++, PHP and also HTML.
### Example of the JS from Codewars
```
function multiply(a, b){
  a * b
}
```

The error was that the function did not contain return. 

The correct code will be:


```
function multiply(a, b){
 return a * b
}
```

I have no practical experience in programming
